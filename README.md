# Rails | AJAX | Health Tracker (Two-day Project)

#### By Noah Yasskin and Maldon Meehan

## Description

Health & Fitness Tracker
Create an application that allows users to track aspects of their health. This could include diet, exercise, water intake, weight, stress levels, moods, productivity levels, remembering to take vitamins or medication, time spent outside, a combination of several, or any other metric of your choosing!

Spend the first part of your day planning out your application with your partner, and drafting additional stories for features you'd like to explore. Again, make use of this time to create an awesome portfolio piece. Peruse other health-focused websites and applications for inspiration, such as MyFitnessPal, RunKeeper, FitDay, LoseIt, MoodTracker, MoodPanda, or any other of the countless health-centric websites and applications available.

Additionally, consider doing something you find interesting with the data you collect from users! For instance, a diet and mood tracker could report trends in a user's reported mood based on how healthy their diet was that week. An application keeping track of jogs, runs or weightlifting could report that you tend to break personal records in the morning, or on weekends, more than any other time of the week. The possibilities are endless.

Below are some potential user stories for a calorie-tracking application. But again, you may focus on any health and/or lifestyle aspect you find most interesting:

* As a user, I want to have a dashboard that shows how many calories I have consumed and how many calories I've burned for the day.
* As a user, I want to be able to press a button to enter a new food I've eaten, and see the calories change and the food appear in a table. (Hint: use AJAX to show and hide the calories form and process/update the calories data.)
* As a user, I want to sort the foods I've eaten alphabetically by name or calories so I can sort through information quickly, and see how different foods rank.
* As a user, I want to search a list of foods to find how many calories they are, or add them to my log. (Hint: seed the database with a list of foods. Use AJAX auto search to find the search item.).
* As a user, I'd like to see charts, graphs and other data visualization breaking down the calories I've consumed, the amount of exercise I've completed today, etc. (Hint: use ChartKick).
* As a user, I would like to set various goals (whether long or short-term) and see how close I am to reaching them
